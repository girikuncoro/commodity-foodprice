# Commodity Food Prices
This project attempts to gather commodity food prices data from each distribution node, e.g. production (farmers), distributors (marketing agent), merchant in market, etc. through SMS based app. The collected data is then further processed to create daily visualization/trends and predict future prices using our defined prediction model.

* The project is developed in hackathon for 70th birthday of Indonesia: http://hackathonmerdeka.id/
